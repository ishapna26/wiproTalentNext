x Every class in java extends java object class
  
In java there are primitive data types. Hence these datatypes makes java 99.99â„… object oriented. Since it is not an object Collection is similar to array
It is a object type where as array is object type
  
Wrapper class: It is found in the java.lang package which gets imported automatically when you create a java file.
-------------
Thats why java has wrapper class
For every primitive type we have class format
For eg we can declare a  integer in two ways
int n=7 or
Integer num=new Integer (value) //this will geneate an warning because we are assigning an int to the class object which is called autoboxing. 
Integer num=8 // in this case the int value is converted in to class automatically. So this is called autoboxing

How to convert the object into int
int num=7
Integer n = num
int n2=n.intValue() // this is called unboxing
Int n2=n //auto unboxing

why we need wrapper class:
--------------------------
1. Collections classes can store only the object we cant store normal integer or any primitive datatye values.
