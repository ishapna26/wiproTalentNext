JAVA : Saved as .Java file
--------------------------
A electronic device that is used to perform computation. Computer can understand only electronic signals.
After writing a code the high level instruction is converted into its bytecode by java compiler. This bytecode is stored in .classfile.
- the machine code in .classfile is not understood by any platforms but only by JVM (which resides in ram of os).
- when the jvm is fed with the bytecode it identifies the latform it is working on.
- it then converts the byte code into its native machine code.
- This code can run in any platforms.

2. Command Line Arguments:
--------------------------
public static void main(String[] args) - " (String[] args) " - Command Line Argument.
- here for the main function we have command line arguments.

import java.util.*;
class Main3{
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		for(int i=0;i<args.length;i++) {
			System.out.println(args[i]);
		}
	}
}

- The result will be nothing because nothing is passed as argument.
- The result will be printed if we pass any arguments for the main function. We do this when we want to give an inut for the java program itself.

JAVA Virtual Machine (JVM):
---------------------------
-Java file code is converted into its byte code by compiler.
-Then the class loader in JVM brings in the class files then the byte code verifier verifies the code and finally execution engine executes the code. 


How does oop differ from structures in c:
----------------------------------------
BECAUSE in structure we can only have datas as its properties/members but not methods. Where as in OOPS we can have datas along with methods/properties inside the class.
